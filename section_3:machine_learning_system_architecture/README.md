# Machine Learning System Architecture
## *And why it matters*

A **System** is composed of:
* **Infrastructure:** from hardware to operating system
* **Applications:** Programs performing specific tasks
* **Data**
* **Documentation**
* **Configuration**

**Architecture** is the term used to describe **Systems**. 

**Architecture**: the way software components are arranged and the interactions between them.

As of ML Systems, developing them is fast and cheap but **maintaining** overtime them is challenging.
