# Deployment of Machine learning models

## Introduction

This **Udemy** course is about how to migrate the models of Machine Learning models from the research stage to production so that they can be applied on live data to make predictions. This is called **Model Deployment**

## Motivation

At the level of a business, leveraging the power of Machine Learning models requires a full deployment in production.

Within a company **Model Deployment** requires the collaboration of:
* Data scientists
* IT teams 
* Dev Ops
* Data engineers
* Software Developers
* Business professionals


 As a **Junior Data Scientist**, I am taking this course to have an overview of the whole pipeline behind Machine Learning involving collaboration of different jobs within a company.

I will allow me to go through the entire life cycle of a machine learning models from research to production:
1. Building a model in notebooks
2. Change this code to production code
3. Discover several deployment solutions: **Paas**, **Iaas**

## Course steps

1. Machine Learning - **Pipeline Overview**

2. Machine Learning - **System Architecture**
3. Building a **reproducible ML pipeline**: from Jupyter notebooks to Production code 
4. Course **setup and key tools**: environment, version control...
5. **ML Pipeline application** (Exercise using 3.)
6. Serving the Model via REST API: using **Flask**
7. **Continuous Integration and Deployment** using CicleCI
8. Differential **testing**
9. Deploy on a **PaaS**: **Heroku**
10. **Containerize the application** using **Docker**
11. Deploy on a **IaaS**:
**AWS**
12. Deploy with **Big Data** with **Deep Learning**
