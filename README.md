# Deployment of Machine learning models

## Introduction

This **Udemy** course is about how to migrate the models of Machine Learning models from the research stage to production so that they can be applied on live data to make predictions. This is called **Model Deployment**

## Motivation

At the level of a business, leveraging the power of Machine Learning models requires a full deployment in production. Model deployment requires coordination between:
- Data scientist
- IT teams/Dev Ops
- Business Domain experts


 As a **Junior Data Scientist**, I am taking this course to have an overview of the whole pipeline behind Machine Learning involving collaboration of different jobs within a company.

I will allow me to go through the entire life cycle of a machine learning models from research to production:
1. Building a model in notebooks
2. Change this code to production code
3. Discover several deployment solutions: **Paas**, **Iaas**

## 4. Model building

### Different models

We can apply any of the three types of models:
1. **Linear models** *ex:* Logistic Regression
2. **Tree models** *ex:* Random Forest
3. **Neural Networks**

## Model evaluation

We can calculate different statistics:
* **ROC-AUC**: for classification problems: good/bad assessment
* **Accuracy**: in percentage
* **MSE, RMSE**


## Model stacking - Meta Ensembling

It consists of taking the prediction of different models and combine them to make a better assessment of the target
