# Creating a ML Pipeline Application

In this section, we will be covering everything from:
- Preparing the training data
- Feature engineering
- Training the model
- Performing prediction within the model package

We will be **packaging the model** so that we can make an easy use of it in other applications

## What will be new?

Key Differences with the code already covered will include:
- Work within a Github repository
- Introduce Tooling (such as Tox)
- Adding Prediction Module
- Introduce Testing
- Versioning
- Logging
- Packaging

## Why does this matter?

Build your models in a way that allows you to:
- Reproduce any prediction
- Reduce the risk of errors
- Debug problems in the code base
- Elegantly handle errors
- Have a modular structure
